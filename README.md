# Giggle - semantic searching in github repos

This is (will be) a re-working of
[A Github Notification Bot for Issue Reviewers with Graph Based NLP](http://graphaware.com/neo4j/nlp/2016/09/06/power-a-github-bot-for-issue-reviewers-with-graph-based-nlp.html) 
but using:

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [JCTools](https://github.com/JCTools/JCTools) perhaps inspired by [Beyond Queues: Novel Concurrent Message Passing Techniques](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7783-beyond-queues-novel-concurrent-message-passing-techniques)
